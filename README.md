# Kernel64

An experimental Linux x86_64 kernel built in a freestanding environment, with Apache License v2

The C99 standard defines two types of implementations: hosted and freestanding.
As in a hosted implementation, a full C standard library environment is available.
But in a freestanding implementation, execution does not require an operating system.

This project follows the freestanding model:

* No hosted C standard library (libc), but libc is not forbidden (simply not provided automatically) and there is the possibility of implementing our own.

* No printf

* No malloc (there is no dynamic memory allocator, initially).


## Purpose of Kernel64

Kernel64 is an educational project designed to understand how software interacts directly with hardware.

Contributors are encouraged to study C fundamentals in their free time and while applying C99 concepts in the kernel environment.

The objective is not to build a production Linux OS, but to understand the fundamental mechanisms underlying modern kernels such as the Linux kernel:

* Boot process mechanics

* Memory layout and control

* Interrupt handling

* Low-level execution flow

The evolution of this project is documented in CHANGELOG.md


## Repository Structure

├── CHANGELOG.md
├── CONTRIBUTING.md

NOTE: As an optional future refinement (not needed yet), once the project grows beyond a certain milestone (M3 or more), it may be necessary to add:

```
├── include/
        kernel/
├── arch/
        x86_64/
```

ATTENTION: You should NOT commit the build/ directory, it must be generated, not versioned. Hence, the following code was added to the .gitignore file:

```
build/
*.o
*.bin
*.elf
*.iso
```

Then, as a strong suggestion and because you do not want to commit build artifacts, run in the Local machine:

```
rm -rf build
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add build artifacts to .gitignore"
```

## Clone Instructions SSH

```
git clone git@github.com:OSTARA711/kernel64.git
```

You need to configure your identity:

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "yourname@example.com"
```

## Architecture of Kernel64

* Target: x86_64

* Bootloader: GRUB (Multiboot2)

* Toolchain: x86_64-elf cross-compiler

* Language: C (freestanding) + Assembly

* Emulator: QEMU

The project is compiled using a freestanding cross-compilation toolchain (x86_64-elf-gcc) to avoid host system dependencies. GCC is available at https://gcc.gnu.org
